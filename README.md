# Job Connector App

## Overview
Our app is designed to bridge the gap for daily wage workers and small-scale service providers in India by providing a platform to access job opportunities easily. These individuals often face difficulties securing work due to the lack of centralized platforms, long queues, and personal visits to find jobs. Our solution connects skilled workers with employers, empowering them to find job opportunities efficiently and reducing the barriers they face.

By offering both recruiters and job seekers a streamlined platform, we aim to improve access to employment opportunities and reduce the challenges workers encounter in the hiring process.
